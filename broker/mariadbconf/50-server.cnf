# * InnoDB
#
# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.

# * Security Features

# Read the manual, too, if you want chroot!

# For generating SSL certificates I recommend the OpenSSL GUI "tinyca".

#
# * Unix socket authentication plugin is built-in since 10.0.22-6
#
# Needed so the root database user can authenticate without a password but
# only when running as the unix root user.
#
# Also available for other users if required.
# See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/unix_socket-authentication-plugin/

# This group is only read by MariaDB servers, not by MySQL.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MySQL and MariaDB,
# you can put MariaDB-only options here

# This group is only read by MariaDB-10.0 servers.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MariaDB of different versions,
# use this group for options that older servers don't understand
[mariadb-10.0]
